\chapter{Preface}

This thesis consists of an introduction, materials and methods, three research chapters, and discussion followed by Bibliography.

All animal experiments were conducted according to the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines, approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of British Columbia, according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocols A14-0290 and A15-0248.

\textbf{In Chapter 3}, All experiments included in this chapter were designed, conducted and analysed by me, unless stated otherwise, with intellectual inputs from Dr. Aparicio. PDX tumor palpations for the first palpable tumor was done by animal technicians of Aparicio lab, Ms. Teresa Ruiz de Algara and Ms. So Ra Lee.

From the drug efficacy \textit{in vitro} cultures, few experiments contributed to the \textit{Nature Communication, 2017} paper:

All PDX dissociation experiments for the \textit{Genome biology} paper was designed and executed by me. Cold Protease digestion was done by Dr.O'Flanagan and bioinformatic analysis were done by Dr. Campbell.
