 \section{Motivation}

In spite of advanced technologies and treatment, triple negative breast cancer still facing the problems of tumor recurrence and drug resistance.
For any given difference between the types of drug resistance, for example, the expression of a particular gene, it is assumed that differences arise deterministically or probabilistically in the configuration of transcription factors regulating the genes in the tumors. Cancer cells in distinct cell- states often exhibit important differences in functional properties depending on the which genes are turned on and off resulting in sensitive or resistant phenotype.

The most challenging analysis is to differentiate whether the change in gene expression leading to change in cellular state is stochastic\cite{raj2008nature} and random or its deterministic to produce the same output under similar environment.
Cancer cells in distinct cell- states often exhibit important differences in functional properties depending on which genes are turned on and off resulting in sensitive  or resistant phenotype.
Previously it is shown that unique cells within a population can exhibit fluctuations in expression of a group of genes, that could predict distinct phenotypes \cite{shaffer2019memory}.
Un-like genomic clones that could get selected in resistant phenotype \cite{salehi2020single}, we still are not clear whether the cell-states are acquainted for this kind of behaviour or the selected states are pre-existing in the cancer population and under continues pressure shows obvious dynamics or there is a transition from one state to another that ultimately gets selected over time. Because of difficulty to analyse longitudinal patient's samples for single cell gene expression and lack of multiple longitudinal pre-clinical breast cancer models, these questions remains unexplored.

Here we set to examine three breast cancer patient derived xenografts (PDX) that were serially challenged for around 4-5 cycles with the drug until they started showing less response to the treatment. We wanted to understand the magnitude of fluctuations in gene expression from sensitive to resistant phenotype.


 \section{Synopsis}
   From the previous chapter we know that the population changes with the tumor growth from one passage to another with and without the drugs. We see the shifts in the clones and some clones get selected and others disappear.
   Now in this chapter, first of all we sought to determine whether under neutral conditions when there is no drug pressure what proportion of the transcriptomes might be copy number driven just due to the natural evolution of the copy number clones. This allows us to understand the stability of the gene expression in our timeseries models in the absence of drugs.
   Next, we explored that on drug being introduced into the system, how much of the drug induced change in expression is dependent on the copy number and which are independent.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Correlation coefficient between copy number and scRNAseq expression}
Clonealign approach \cite{campbell2019clonealign} was used to reveal clone-specific phenotypic properties. The serially passaged triple-negative breast cancer patient-derived xenografts from Chapter 4 as substrates.
Each point is the proportion of DLP cells in a clone (x axis) versus the proportion of the tenx cells in the same clone. Then calculate the correlation coefficient for all clones.
