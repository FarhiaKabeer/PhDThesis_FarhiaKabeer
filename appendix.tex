	\textbf{TNBC PDX timeseries showing timepoint nodes used for single cell whole genome sequencing}
	     All nodes representing each PDX tumour were digested to acquire genomes of single cells (~200-600 cells/tumor). Extra replicate tumors at each time point are not shown in the diagram (n=2-4). Grey circles represent un-treated, blue represents Cisplatin treated and grey with blue outline presents drug-holiday samples 
	     \textbf{(a)} SA609-TNBC time series with replicates. DLP+ collected starting from X1 to X10 (Un-Rx line 1). Top grey branch indicating Un-Rx line 2. The middle three branches are cisplatin treated time series replicate branches 
	     \textbf{(b)} SA535-TNBC  showing the tumor nodes taken for DLP+ starting from X5 untreated  \textbf{(c)} SA1035-TNBC  showing the tumor nodes taken for DLP+ starting from X 4 untreated.}

\textbf{Observed trajectories including drug-holiday samples.}
Panels showing line trajectories of clonal behaviour over time in two additional TNBC all three conditions. Fitness reversal in drug holiday samples of SA1035 and SA535 were not very prominent as compare to SA609. Horizontal axis representing the timepoints of each generation and vertical axis shows clonal fractions.
