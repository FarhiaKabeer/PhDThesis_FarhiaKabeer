	abstract = {Essential features of cancer tissue cellular heterogeneity such as negatively selected genome topologies, sub-clonal mutation patterns and genome replication states can only effectively be studied by sequencing single-cell genomes at scale and high fidelity. Using an amplification-free single-cell genome sequencing approach implemented on commodity hardware (DLP+) coupled with a cloud-based computational platform, we define a resource of 40,000 single-cell genomes characterized by their genome states, across a wide range of tissue types and conditions. We show that shallow sequencing across thousands of genomes permits reconstruction of clonal genomes to single nucleotide resolution through aggregation analysis of cells sharing higher order genome structure. From large-scale population analysis over thousands of cells, we identify rare cells exhibiting mitotic mis-segregation of whole chromosomes. We observe that tissue derived scWGS libraries exhibit lower rates of whole chromosome anueploidy than cell lines, and loss of p53 results in a shift in event type, but not overall prevalence in breast epithelium. Finally, we demonstrate that the replication states of genomes can be identified, allowing the number and proportion of replicating cells, as well as the chromosomal pattern of replication to be unambiguously identified in single-cell genome sequencing experiments. The combined annotated resource and approach provide a re-implementable large scale platform for studying lineages and tissue heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of bulk tumour tissue can identify constituent cell populations in cancers and measure their abundance. This requires computational deconvolution of allelic counts from somatic mutations, which may be incapable of fully resolving the underlying population structure. Single cell sequencing (SCS) is a more direct method, although its replacement of NGS is impeded by technical noise and sampling limitations. We propose ddClone, which analytically integrates NGS and SCS data, leveraging their complementary attributes through joint statistical inference. We show on real and simulated datasets that ddClone produces more accurate results than can be achieved by either method alone.},

@article{test1,
	Abstract = { PurposeGermline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) are associated with favorable responses to chemotherapy. However, secondary intragenic (reversion) mutations that restore protein function lead to clinically significant rates of acquired resistance. The goal of this study was to determine whether reversion mutations could be found in an unbiased manner in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to predict treatment response in HGSC.Patients and MethodsPlasma and tumor samples were obtained from 30 patients with HGSC with either BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation. Two cohorts were ascertained: patients with a malignancy before undergoing primary HGSC debulking surgery (n = 14) or patients at disease recurrence (n = 16). Paired tumor and plasma samples were available for most patients (24 of 30). Targeted amplicon, next-generation sequencing was performed using primers that flanked germline mutations, whose design did not rely on prior knowledge of reversion sequences.ResultsFive patients were identified with intragenic mutations predicted to restore BRCA1/2 open reading frames, including two patients with multiple independent reversion alleles. Reversion mutations were only detected in tumor samples from patients with recurrent disease (five of 16) and only in cfDNA from patients with a tumor-detected reversion (three of five). Findings from a rapid autopsy of a patient with multiple independent reversions indicated that reversion-allele frequency in metastatic sites is an important determinant of assay sensitivity. Abundance of tumor-derived DNA in total cell-free DNA, as measured by TP53 mutant allele frequency, also affected assay sensitivity. All patients with reversions detected in tumor-derived DNA were resistant to platin- or poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor-based chemotherapy.ConclusionReversion mutations can be detected in an unbiased analysis of cfDNA, suggesting clinical utility for predicting chemotherapy response in recurrent HGSC. },

@article{timeSeriesSelection,
	Abstract = {The advent of accessible ancient DNA technology now allows the direct ascertainment of allele frequencies in ancestral populations, thereby enabling the use of allele frequency time series to detect and estimate natural selection. Such direct observations of allele frequency dynamics are expected to be more powerful than inferences made using patterns of linked neutral variation obtained from modern individuals. We developed a Bayesian method to make use of allele frequency time series data and infer the parameters of general diploid selection, along with allele age, in non-equilibrium populations. We introduce a novel path augmentation approach, in which we use Markov chain Monte Carlo to integrate over the space of allele frequency trajectories consistent with the observed data. Using simulations, we show that this approach has good power to estimate selection coefficients and allele age. Moreover, when applying our approach to data on horse coat color, we find that ignoring a relevant demographic history can significantly bias the results of inference. Our approach is made available in a C++ software package.},

@article{McFarland026302,
	Abstract = {Genomic instability causes cancers to acquire hundreds to thousands of mutations and chromosomal alterations during their somatic evolution. Most of these mutations and alterations are termed passengers because they do not confer cancer phenotypes. Evolutionary simulations and cancer genomic studies suggested that mildly-deleterious passengers accumulate, collectively slow cancer progression, reduce the fitness of cancer cells and enhance the effects of therapeutics. However, these effects of passengers and their impact on clinical variables remain limited to genomic analysis. Here, to assess passengers{\textquoteright} effect on cell fitness and cancer, we specifically introduced increasing passenger loads into human cell lines and mouse models. We found that passenger load dramatically reduced cancer cell{\textquoteright}s fitness in every model investigated. Passengers{\textquoteright} average fitness cost of ~3\% per MB, indicates that genomic instability in cancer in patients can slow tumor growth and prevent metastatic progression. We conclude that genomic instability in cancer is a double-edged sword: it accelerates the accumulation of adaptive drivers, yet incurs a harmful passenger load that can outweigh drivers{\textquoteright} benefit. Passenger load could be a useful biomarker for tumor aggressiveness and response to mutagenic or passenger-exacerbating therapies, including anti-tumor immunity.},

	abstract = {Essential features of cancer tissue cellular heterogeneity such as negatively selected genome topologies, sub-clonal mutation patterns and genome replication states can only effectively be studied by sequencing single-cell genomes at scale and high fidelity. Using an amplification-free single-cell genome sequencing approach implemented on commodity hardware (DLP+) coupled with a cloud-based computational platform, we define a resource of 40,000 single-cell genomes characterized by their genome states, across a wide range of tissue types and conditions. We show that shallow sequencing across thousands of genomes permits reconstruction of clonal genomes to single nucleotide resolution through aggregation analysis of cells sharing higher order genome structure. From large-scale population analysis over thousands of cells, we identify rare cells exhibiting mitotic mis-segregation of whole chromosomes. We observe that tissue derived scWGS libraries exhibit lower rates of whole chromosome anueploidy than cell lines, and loss of p53 results in a shift in event type, but not overall prevalence in breast epithelium. Finally, we demonstrate that the replication states of genomes can be identified, allowing the number and proportion of replicating cells, as well as the chromosomal pattern of replication to be unambiguously identified in single-cell genome sequencing experiments. The combined annotated resource and approach provide a re-implementable large scale platform for studying lineages and tissue heterogeneity.},

Their range of applications remains limited by signal variability from different guide RNAs targeting the same gene, which confounds analysis, and dictates large experiment sizes. To address this problem, we report JACKS, a Bayesian method that jointly analyses screens performed with the same guide RNA library. Modeling the variable guide efficacies greatly improves hit identification, and allows a 2.5-fold reduction in required cell numbers without sacrificing performance compared to current analysis standards.},

	Abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of bulk tumour tissue can identify constituent cell populations in cancers and measure their abundance. This requires computational deconvolution of allelic counts from somatic mutations, which may be incapable of fully resolving the underlying population structure. Single cell sequencing (SCS) is a more direct method, although its replacement of NGS is impeded by technical noise and sampling limitations. We propose ddClone, which analytically integrates NGS and SCS data, leveraging their complementary attributes through joint statistical inference. We show on real and simulated datasets that ddClone produces more accurate results than can be achieved by either method alone.},

@article{test1,
	Abstract = { PurposeGermline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) are associated with favorable responses to chemotherapy. However, secondary intragenic (reversion) mutations that restore protein function lead to clinically significant rates of acquired resistance. The goal of this study was to determine whether reversion mutations could be found in an unbiased manner in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to predict treatment response in HGSC.Patients and MethodsPlasma and tumor samples were obtained from 30 patients with HGSC with either BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation. Two cohorts were ascertained: patients with a malignancy before undergoing primary HGSC debulking surgery (n = 14) or patients at disease recurrence (n = 16). Paired tumor and plasma samples were available for most patients (24 of 30). Targeted amplicon, next-generation sequencing was performed using primers that flanked germline mutations, whose design did not rely on prior knowledge of reversion sequences.ResultsFive patients were identified with intragenic mutations predicted to restore BRCA1/2 open reading frames, including two patients with multiple independent reversion alleles. Reversion mutations were only detected in tumor samples from patients with recurrent disease (five of 16) and only in cfDNA from patients with a tumor-detected reversion (three of five). Findings from a rapid autopsy of a patient with multiple independent reversions indicated that reversion-allele frequency in metastatic sites is an important determinant of assay sensitivity. Abundance of tumor-derived DNA in total cell-free DNA, as measured by TP53 mutant allele frequency, also affected assay sensitivity. All patients with reversions detected in tumor-derived DNA were resistant to platin- or poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor-based chemotherapy.ConclusionReversion mutations can be detected in an unbiased analysis of cfDNA, suggesting clinical utility for predicting chemotherapy response in recurrent HGSC. },

@article{timeSeriesSelection,
	Abstract = {The advent of accessible ancient DNA technology now allows the direct ascertainment of allele frequencies in ancestral populations, thereby enabling the use of allele frequency time series to detect and estimate natural selection. Such direct observations of allele frequency dynamics are expected to be more powerful than inferences made using patterns of linked neutral variation obtained from modern individuals. We developed a Bayesian method to make use of allele frequency time series data and infer the parameters of general diploid selection, along with allele age, in non-equilibrium populations. We introduce a novel path augmentation approach, in which we use Markov chain Monte Carlo to integrate over the space of allele frequency trajectories consistent with the observed data. Using simulations, we show that this approach has good power to estimate selection coefficients and allele age. Moreover, when applying our approach to data on horse coat color, we find that ignoring a relevant demographic history can significantly bias the results of inference. Our approach is made available in a C++ software package.},

	Abstract = {Genomic instability causes cancers to acquire hundreds to thousands of mutations and chromosomal alterations during their somatic evolution. Most of these mutations and alterations are termed passengers because they do not confer cancer phenotypes. Evolutionary simulations and cancer genomic studies suggested that mildly-deleterious passengers accumulate, collectively slow cancer progression, reduce the fitness of cancer cells and enhance the effects of therapeutics. However, these effects of passengers and their impact on clinical variables remain limited to genomic analysis. Here, to assess passengers{\textquoteright} effect on cell fitness and cancer, we specifically introduced increasing passenger loads into human cell lines and mouse models. We found that passenger load dramatically reduced cancer cell{\textquoteright}s fitness in every model investigated. Passengers{\textquoteright} average fitness cost of ~3\% per MB, indicates that genomic instability in cancer in patients can slow tumor growth and prevent metastatic progression. We conclude that genomic instability in cancer is a double-edged sword: it accelerates the accumulation of adaptive drivers, yet incurs a harmful passenger load that can outweigh drivers{\textquoteright} benefit. Passenger load could be a useful biomarker for tumor aggressiveness and response to mutagenic or passenger-exacerbating therapies, including anti-tumor immunity.},

              interpreting the vast amount of genomic data in the light of
              cancer evolution remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that
              neutral tumor evolution results in a power-law distribution of
              the mutant allele frequencies reported by next-generation
              sequencing of tumor bulk samples. We find that the neutral power
              law fits with high precision 323 of 904 cancers from 14 types and
              from different cohorts. In malignancies identified as evolving
              neutrally, all clonal selection seemingly occurred before the
              onset of cancer growth and not in later-arising subclones,
              resulting in numerous passenger mutations that are responsible
              for intratumoral heterogeneity. Reanalyzing cancer sequencing
              data within the neutral framework allowed the measurement, in
              each patient, of both the in vivo mutation rate and the order and
              timing of mutations. This result provides a new way to interpret

              Signatures of BFB cycles can be observed in cancer genomes
              alongside chromothripsis, another catastrophic mutational
              phenomenon. We explain this association by elucidating a

              error-chromosome bridge formation-that rapidly increases genomic
              complexity. We show that actomyosin forces are required for
              initial bridge breakage. Chromothripsis accumulates, beginning
              with aberrant interphase replication of bridge DNA. A subsequent
              burst of DNA replication in the next mitosis generates extensive
              DNA damage. During this second cell division, broken bridge
              chromosomes frequently missegregate and form micronuclei,
              promoting additional chromothripsis. We propose that iterations

              parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this
              variation at the whole-genome scale1-3. Here we report the
              integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their
              matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the
              Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the
              International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer
              Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG
              resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute
              clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations
              when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however,
              in around 5\% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting
              that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis,
              in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single
              catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour
              evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede
              most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated
              genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance
              often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and
              show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to
              critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect
              patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations,
              structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection
              of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding
              mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter4;
              identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base

              variation5,6; analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution7;

              mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and

              we develop methods to group, classify and describe somatic
              structural variants, using data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of
              Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer
              Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),
              which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers
              across 38 tumour types8. Sixteen signatures of structural
              variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution,
              assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in
              late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem
              duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are
              enriched in early-replicating regions-as are unbalanced
              translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement
              generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number
              gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent
              structure consists of 2-7 templates copied from distinct regions
              of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of
              templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and-in
              liver cancer-frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT. A wide
              variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which

              dynamical process that governs how mutations arise and spread
              through a population. However, it is difficult to observe these
              dynamics directly over long periods and across entire genomes.
              Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve
              experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome
              metagenomic sequencing at five hundred-generation intervals
              through sixty thousand generations. Although the rate of fitness
              gain declines over time, molecular evolution is characterized by
              signatures of rapid adaptation throughout the duration of the
              experiment, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously
              competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between
              ecological and evolutionary processes play an important role, as
              long-term quasi-stable coexistence arises spontaneously in most
              populations, and evolution continues within each clade. We also
              present evidence that the targets of natural selection change
              over time, as epistasis and historical contingency alter the
              strength of selection on different genes. Together, these results
              show that long-term adaptation to a constant environment can be a
              more complex and dynamic process than is often assumed.",

  Sequencing data from a single biopsy represent a snapshot of this

              aberrations and the changing influence of mutational processes3.
              Here, by whole-genome sequencing analysis of 2,658 cancers as

              Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)

              history and evolution of mutational processes and driver mutation
              sequences of 38 types of cancer. Early oncogenesis is
              characterized by mutations in a constrained set of driver genes,
              and specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma
              and isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. The mutational spectrum
              changes significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40\% of
              samples. A nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and
              increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy
              number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to
              simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses
              suggest that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many
              years, if not decades. Together, these results determine the
