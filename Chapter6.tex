Predicting the dynamics of malignant cells in cancers and deconstructing the molecular basis of resistance and metastasis can be achieved by repeated observation of cell populations with shared genotypes and phenotypes. In this thesis project we have shown that cell population dynamics in cancer can be resolved by assigning cells to specific clones, defined by somatic mutations at any scale of the genome, copy number, SNVs, structural rearrangements. 

We repeatedly observe the similar fitness coefficients for the same copy number genotypes, showing deterministic behaviour. The fitness differences between most clones is small, despite large changes in clone prevalence over time.






Individual tumors and cancer cells exhibit substantial molecular diversity
