}
\label{ch:Chapter4}

\section{Motivation}
As discussed in introduction chapter 1, tumor fitness landscape underpin selection in cancer evolution and response to chemotherapy. However, quantifying clonal fitness in heterogeneous tumor populations remains an open problem that hampers effective treatment leading to tumor recurrence. Previous work has established models of fitness through interpreting allelic measurements of single snapshots \cite{williams2016identification, williams2018quantification,gerstung2020evolutionary,shah2012clonal,nik2012life} from bulk sequencing over large patient cohorts \cite{martincorena2017universal}, timeseries study of cell free DNA \cite{khan2018longitudinal}, multiregion sequencing \cite{Gerlinger2014-qd,Jamal-Hanjani2017-yc,Lopez2020-ku,mcpherson2016divergent,williams2018quantification} and estimating fitness landscapes of clonal haematopoiesis \cite{Watson2020-yu}. Moreover, the cancer field has generally lacked serial measurements from patient derived tissues to directly observe cancer evolution over realistic timescales. This has impeded a thorough understanding of causal factors driving selection, achieved in other biological systems through studying granular timeseries with population genetics modeling \cite{good2017dynamics}. Taking multiple measurements is critical for understanding  given behavior of cancer clones that are forced to evolve over time, and doing so at equal intervals give an open opportunity to clearly investigate the dynamics of that behavior manifesting at distinct time scales. Infact, patient derived xenograft (PDX)\cite{aparicio2015examining} systems are an effective model to study timeseries of a human tumour cell population \cite{williams2018using,willey2015patient}.
The majority of the work on cancer has focused on bulk tumour sequencing, where cellular population structure decomposition approaches are limited. Single cell genome measurements to scalably define clonal populations in cancer over thousands of cells have only recently emerged \cite{Laks2019-dm,zahn2017scalable}, enabling identification of rare populations, precise tracking of clones and robust clone-specific measurements suitable for population genetics modeling. We are also motivated by newly developed quantifying tools of \texttt{sitka}, a phylogenetic inference method accompanying toolkits to assign cells to clones, \cite{dorri2020efficient} and  \texttt{fitClone}, a probabilistic framework that designates quantitative selection coefficients to individual cancer clones and forecasts competitive clonal dynamics over time \cite{salehi2020single}. Motivated by these observations, we sought to investigate the hypothesis that clones that grow reproducibly have higher fitness in the growing cancer.



\section{Synopsis}
Based on the knowledge we gained from chapter 3 for transplant efficiency and initial tumor responses to chemotherapies, we selected four \textit{Tp53} mutant \ac{PDX} for this chapter \textbf{\autoref{tab:Tp53mutationofPDX}}. Three TNBC and one HER2+ \ac{PDX} tumors. For the chemotherapy, two drugs (cisplatin and CX-5461) were selected to investigate clonal dynamics and identify patterns of clonal resistance with single cell whole genome sequencing in treated and untreated timeseries. First we, studied un-treated 4 transplanted timeseries, including two PDXs (HER2+SA532 and TNBC-SA609), especially passaged upto ten generations (X1 to X10). By applying newly developed methods, for identifying sub-populations with their genotypes, 
e showed that serial measurements of single cell copy number assigned clones can be used to estimate fitness in conjunction with \texttt{fitClone} \cite{salehi2020single}. Under serial transplantation of breast patient derived xenografts, where no drug selection or other conditions were applied, we found that serial measurements can be used to measure relative clonal fitness which enables prediction of future trajectories.

Next, we sought to  confirm the reproducibility and independence of dynamics to population size effects, we re-ran the serial transplantation experiments after mixing early and late populations and re-measuring the dynamical behaviour. We observed that sufficiently well sampled clones with confident fitness estimations show repeated trajectories, confirming the estimation of fitness and linking the dynamical behaviour to the copy number genotypes of the clones.

Finally, we determined whether the fitness of clones under chemotherapy can be measured and asked whether clones exhibiting drug resistance are also fitter in the absence of selective pressure from chemotherapy. 

On all the single cell whole genome sequencing data, we applied three types of scientific computational methodologies. First, \textbf{sitka}, for computing phylogenetic trees and identifying genotypic clones, then using \textbf{Lumberjack} (a tree-cutting algorithm) and their relative abundances as a function of time. Last, \texttt{fitClone}, to measure the selection coefficient for each clone (\textit{s}) which we hypothesise to indicate growth potential. The larger the value of \textit{s}, the more fit the clone is relative to the chosen reference clone.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Modeling clonal fitness and selection}
With close collaboration of our bioinformatic colleagues, we  developed an experimental and computational platform consisting of three major components: scalable phylogenetics for single cell genomes to identify clones, timeseries sampling of patient derived xenografts over multiple month timeframes to observe clonal dynamics, and a mathematical model for inferring clone-specific fitness measures (\textbf{\autoref{fig:schematic}}). We studied breast cancer PDX, sequencing $>$123,106 cells over interval passaging (\textbf{\autoref{fig:schematic} a}), with single cell whole genome sequencing\cite{laks2019clonal} (scDNAseq, DLP+ method) from 101 libraries. From single cell copy number profiles we calculated phylogenetic trees to identify genotypic clones and their relative abundances as a function of time (\textbf{\autoref{fig:schematic} b}).
Timeseries clonal abundance observations were modeled using an implementation of the Wright-Fisher diffusion process  (\textbf{\autoref{fig:schematic} c}, we called \texttt{fitClone} \textbf{see methods}). \texttt{fitClone} simultaneously estimates growth trajectories, $X_i$ and fitness coefficients, $s_i$ for each clone $i$ in the population. 
We note that even small increments in $1+s_i$ indicate positive selection and higher growth potential. The model accounts for drift as well as selection, with fitness estimated relative to a reference population, where $s=0$ by construction. As a generative process, the model can be used for forecasting evolutionary trajectories of specific clones and posterior probability densities can be interpreted for evidence of positive selection in polyclonal systems. 

We carried out simulation experiments to establish theoretical behaviour and limitations of \texttt{fitClone}, over a range of parameters.  In two key advances, simultaneous modeling of multiple clones was superior to modeling each clone independently, and accounting for stochasticity in the dynamics via the diffusion process led to more accurate selection coefficient estimates than with a deterministic growth model (\textbf{\autoref{fig:simulations} a}). Model fits were robust to effective population size ($N_e$) and number of clones (\textbf{\autoref{fig:simulations}b,c}). Together these simulations established a rationale for systematic modeling of all clones in a unified approach, enabling  interpretations of dynamics exhibited in polyclonal cancers.

\subsection{Establishment of untreated timeseries patient derived xenografts}

To understand and quantify fitness attributes of cancer cells as  predictive measures of their growth potential in polyclonal systems, we set out to establish timeseries patient derived xenografts (PDX) with and without pharmacological perturbations (\textbf{\autoref{fig:schematic} a}).
Serial transplantations of four \textit{p53 mutant} human breast cancers were performed by injecting patient derived tumor cells and clumps into primary engrafted mice to secondary and subsequent recipients in a timeseries manner (\textbf{\autoref{fig:Untreatedgrowthcurves} a-top), n=3-4 at each time point)}. 
We generated timeseries observations from these untreated PDX, sampled over 927 days for HER2+SA532, 619 days for TNBC-SA609, 381 days for TNBC-SA1035 and 353 days for TNBC-SA535. 

To asses the growth potential over time and receptor status information, two PDXs (HER2+SA532 and TNBC-SA609-Line 1) were passaged comparatively longer, upto ten generations (X1-X10).
 (\textbf{\autoref{fig:Untreatedgrowthcurves} a-Bottom}).
 A median of 907 single cell genomes were sequenced per passage for a total of 11,705 and 10,553 single cell genomes from the HER2+SA532 and TNBC-SA609-Line 1 series, respectively. 
Growth record in all of timeseries exhibited progressively higher tumour growth rates over time (\textbf{\autoref{fig:Untreatedgrowthcurves} b}, \textbf{\autoref{fig:SA609allcyclescisplatin} b-d}). To confirm the architecture and integrity of patient's tumor, H \& E and immuno-histochemistry staining of paraffin embedded tumor sections were created at each time point with a set of standard markers. \textbf{(See Methods, {\autoref{fig:HistologyHER2+TNBC}} a, b)} is showing representative images of initial and late passages of tumor sections.

\subsection{Copy number associated clonal fitness in \textit{p53 mutant} human breast cancers}

Next, we sought to study clonal expansions through serial passaging, acquiring single cell whole genome sequencing and applying fitness modeling to all four \textit{p53 mutant} PDX timeseries.
DLP+ libraries were generated and sequenced, yielding a median of 303 single cell genomes per sample (9,970 total cells) of high quality for downstream analysis. Bulk WGS and DLP+ confirmed all four tumors harbored \textit{TP53} mutations (TNBC-SA609: \textit{p.R213X}; TNBC-SA1035: \textit{p.C242F}; HER2+SA532: \textit{p.A159P}; TNBC-SA535: \textit{p.V147Gfs*2}) with bi-allelic and truncal distribution across clones (\textbf{\autoref{tab:Tp53mutationofPDX}}).
Resulting phylogenetic analysis indicated all PDX were polyclonal at the copy number level.

\subsubsection{Phylogenetics and fitness analysis of untreated timeseries PDXs}
 For all timeseries, we inferred single cell copy number profiles , constructed a phylogenetic tree using \textbf{sitka} model taking copy number states as input to establish clonal lineages and measured clonal abundances as a function of time \textbf{(\autoref{fig:SA535heatmapdynamicsHER2} }, \textbf{\autoref{fig:SA1035SA609UnRx}}). For each timeseries (branch), we pulled all single cells to infer a phylogenetic tree \textbf{(See introduction and methods for details)}. The tree was cut using Lumberjack to yield clones and their abundances over time. Then \texttt{fitClone} inferred selection coefficient of a clone by reporting the posterior mean 1 + s followed by its standard deviation.

\subsubsection{Untreated timeseries HER2+SA532 PDX undergo neutral clonal dynamics as compared to TNBC-SA535}
In contrast with HER2+SA532, the TNBC PDX models exhibited evidence of clonal dynamics and variation in selection coefficients consistent with positive selection and differential fitness (\textbf{\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} a}). 
In TNBC-SA535, we acquired scWGS on 5 consecutively transplanted timepoints (X5, X6, X7, X8, X9) untreated \textbf{(\autoref{fig:schematic} a)} \textbf{(\autoref{fig:treatedtimeseriesmanuscript} b)} for a total of 1,341 single cells (mean = 335, $\sigma$ = 84.4 per timepoint).
11 clones \textbf{(\autoref{fig:SA535heatmapdynamicsHER2} a, b, c}) were observed, although only three major clones propagated after the initial time point.
The inferred clonal fractions were A(0.003), B(0.702), C(0.034), D(0.006), E(0.006), F(0.013), and G(0.237). Other 4 were below the threshold.
Clone C was chosen as the reference clone as it had a monotonically decreasing clonal fraction trajectory in the untreated branch. Clonal trajectories were consistent with selection coefficients
with small relative differences in fitness (\textbf{\autoref{fig:SA535heatmapdynamicsHER2} a-d}). Clone G had the highest fitness (1 + s = 1.01 $\pm$ 0.00751) \textbf{\autoref{fig:SA535heatmapdynamicsHER2} a-d}. 
 Clone G, characterized by \textbf{loss of ChrX} exhibited expansion from minor prevalence at passage X5 to near dominance at 76\% at passage X9 (selection coefficient $1+s$ = 1.02  $\pm$  0.01, (\textbf{\autoref{fig:SA535heatmapdynamicsHER2}}). 
 However, the HER2+SA532 series exhibited 4 distinct clones ranging in size from 134 to 1,421 cells ( \textbf{median 319, \textbf{\autoref{fig:SA535heatmapdynamicsHER2} e, f}}). Notably, none of the clones in the HER2+ series exhibited $1+s$ $>$ 1.015 suggesting a lack of positive selection.
 Clonal trajectories in the HER2+ model, were consistent with selective coefficients with small relative differences in fitness (\textbf{\autoref{fig:SA535heatmapdynamicsHER2} f-i})

\subsubsection{Untreated timeseries TNBC-SA1035 and TNBC-SA609 PDX undergo deterministic clonal dynamics}
For TNBC-SA1035, scWGS data collected from an untreated branch with five serial passages (X4, X5, X6, X7, and X8) \textbf{\autoref{fig:treatedtimeseriesmanuscript} b)} with a total of 2,015 single cells. 11 clones were detected (\textbf{\autoref{fig:SA1035SA609UnRx} a,b}) with clone E expanding to 69\% at passage X8 from minor prevalence at the initial timepoint (selection coefficient $1+s$ = 1.06 $\pm$0.03) (\textbf{\autoref{fig:SA1035SA609UnRx} c,d}). Clonal fractions over all timepoints in the untreated branch were A(0.097), B(0.140), C(0.087), D(0.160), E(0.266), F(0.010), G(0.058), H(0.053), I(0.065), J(0.018), and K(0.047). The reference clone A in this series had initial prevalence of 20\% but was not detectable by the last timepoint. Clone E rose from a clonal fraction of 0.028 at X4 to 0.69 at X8 and had the highest selection coefficient (1+s = 1.06 $\pm$ 0.0367). \textbf{Clone E} formed a distinct clade in the phylogeny, distinguished by a hemizygous deletion of the centromeric locus of \textbf{Chr8p}, an extra copy gain of the telomeric end of \textbf{Chr11q} and a focal gain of \textbf{Chr 9q21} harboring the \textit{CCNE1} locus as compared to reference clone C (\textbf{\autoref{fig:SA1035SA609UnRx} a}, \textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609mix} a}).

Similarly, in untreated TNBC-SA609 timeseries, six clones were observed and clones E (\textbf{\autoref{fig:SA1035SA609UnRx} b}, light blue, $1+s$ = 1.07 $\pm$ 0.02 ) and H (\textbf{\autoref{fig:SA1035SA609UnRx}} b, light purple, $1+s$ = 1.02 $\pm$ 0.02) had the highest selection coefficients, exhibiting growth from undetectable levels to 59\% and 32\% respectively by timepoint X10. Clone C contracted from near 100\% at the initial timepoint to undetectable levels by X10 \textbf{\autoref{fig:SA1035SA609UnRx} g-i}). Growth of clones E, G, and H and contraction of clone C was observed reproducibly from replicate transplants (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609mix} d}).
Consistent with increased dynamics in the TNBC-SA609 line 1 series, we found an initial increase of 0.1 breakpoints per cell per generation in the first 4 passages \textbf{(\autoref{fig:mutationanalysisbreakpoints} a)}. Clone E also had the highest number of breakpoints with 12.8 additional copy number breakpoints per cell, relative to the reference clone C with the lowest (linear regression with coverage breadth, ploidy and cell cycle state as covariates (p $<$0.0001) \textbf{(\autoref{fig:mutationanalysisbreakpoints} c)}.

By contrast, in all 3 TNBC series at least one clone showed a high degree of clonal fitness with pairwise probability of positive selection $>$ 0.9  \textbf{\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} a},\textbf{(\autoref{fig:landscapefitness} a}), consistent with diverse CNA clonal genotypes linked to high variation in fitness.

\subsection{Clone-specific fitness estimates forecast clonal competition trajectories} 
We next asked whether the high predicted fitness of Clone E was a true indicator of positive selection through a physical clonal mixing and re-transplant experiment. Enforced clonal competition of higher fitness clones with lower fitness counterparts should result in re-emergence or fixation of high fitness clones, even when re-starting from a low population prevalence. To test this, we performed mixture experiments by extracting cells from an early (X3) and a late (X8) passage of TNBC-SA609 (line 1) timeseries PDX and then physically mixed them. We established two such lines with different proportions \textbf{(also see methods)}.
In first \textbf{branch a}, we aimed to have a mixture comprising approximately of equal proportions from the two timepoints ($\approx$~50\% each) at the ratio of 1:1. In \textbf{branch b}, we aimed to have far less cells from late passage that contains the high fitness clone. The (71\% of X3 passage and 29.0\% of cells from the X8 passage) a ratio of 1:0.4.


\subsubsection{Clones with higher selection coefficients out compete low fitness clones in mixture branch a}
To validate the selection coefficients as indicators of positive selection, we forward-simulated trajectories from \texttt{fitClone} using estimated selection coefficients (B=1.00 $\pm$ 0.01, D=1.00 $\pm$ 0.01, G=1.01 $\pm$ 0.01, H=1.02 $\pm$ 0.02, E=1.07 $\pm$ 0.02). We compared two independent starting clonal proportions of (B=0.08, C=0.25, D=0.51, E=0.02, G=0.08, H=0.07) and (C=0.02, D=0.00, E=0.05, G=0.06, H=0.87), derived by mixing cells from a late (X8) and an early (X3) passage of the TNBC-SA609 (Line 1) series in mixture-retransplant-serial passage experiments as mentioned above \textbf{\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} b}). Simulated trajectories from the first set of starting proportions resulted in \textbf{clone E} with the highest probability of fixation (0.39). Fixation probabilities for the remainder of clones were low ($<$0.01). \textbf{\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} c} shows the simulated trajectories in black.
The mean clonal fraction at each step is shown in red. All clones except for clones E and H are predicted to vanish to clonal fractions of below 1\%. 

%We have combined the trajectories for clones E and F since clone F (i) had fewer than 19 total cells in the original series and consequently its selection coefficient had a high variance, (ii) is phylogenetically proximal to clone E \textbf{\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} d} and thus likely represented a biologically similar population and (iii) finally, is not observed above a threshold of 20 cells in any other line in the TNBC-SA609 family.

We experimentally tested these predictions by initiating a new PDX line with the remixed population (from M0), serially passaged over 4 timepoints \textbf{\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} b} (top), and sequenced with DLP+ (6,453 single cell genomes, median 1,287 per library). After placing the cells from all timepoints of this mixture experiment on the tree, they got assigned to six clones from the original timeseries were recovered having 26 to 767 (median 155) cells \textbf{\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} d-left} . In \textbf{\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} c} blue dots show the observed clonal fractions at each timepoint in PDX branch a. Clones with higher selection coefficients swept through the mixture timeseries by passage 4 (\textbf{\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} d-middle, right}). Comparison of model fits of the original and mixture timeseries yielded similar posterior distributions for the majority of clones. As anticipated by the model, clone E emerged as a high fitness clone ($1+s$ = 1.08  $\pm$ 0.03), and at the last timepoint, clones E and H comprised 94\% of cells \textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609mix} c, d, e}. 
The estimated selection co-efficients were relatively strongly correlated (Pearson correlation of 0.795, considering only clones that reached overall prevalence of over 1\% in the original series.

\subsubsection{Mixture branch b recapitulates the predicted dynamics of branch a and the original untreated branch}

Similar to mixture a, for mixture branch b (low proportion clone E mix), we initiated another new PDX, serially passaged over 5 timepoints \textbf{(\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} b}), and sequenced with DLP+  (6,730 single cell genomes, median 1,270 per library).
We forward simulated 10,000 trajectories using identical selection coefficient values as the first mixture branch a, but different clonal proportions, estimated from adding cells from timepoint X1 in mixture branch b to the TNBC-SA609 phylogenetic tree and assigning them to the corresponding clones (C = 0.02, D = 0.00, E = 0.05, F = 0.00, G = 0.06, H = 0.87). Unlike mixture branch a, DLP+ data was not available for timepoint M0 in mixture branch b.
For the second mixture \textbf{(\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} e}), cells from four clones (C, E, G, and H) from the original timeseries were observed (clone D had only  1 cell). Clone E was the only clone that increased in prevalence (from 5 to 24\%) and had the highest selection coefficient ($1 + s$ = 1.02 $\pm$ 0.03.  By contrast, Clones C, G and H appeared to exhibit neutral fitness. 

The analysis of the two mixture series suggests that (i) we can validate the selection coefficients estimated from a timeseries using \texttt{fitClone} and (ii) it is possible make quantitative predictions about the likely trajectories of tumour subpopulations at least at the clade level. Also, in the prediction trajectories plot \textbf{(\autoref{fig:Mixturenew} c, f)}, the time-axis for the observations is shrunk to best match the mean predicted trajectories line (red line). The diffusion time horizon that is obtained by dividing the generation time measured in days by the effective population size estimate results in trajectories that are ahead of the biological system.
Thus, both mixture experiments resulted in expansion of the highest fitness clone E, even when starting from proportions of 0.02 and 0.05, consistent with the predicted selection coefficients and forecasts of clonal competition.

\subsection{Clonal competition and fitness costs of platinum resistance}
So far, we have applied our framework to pharmacologically unperturbed tumor environment to track human cancer clones as identified by their Copy number genotypes over time and to reason about their likely abundances and validating them with specific experimental conditions. Next, we asked how drug treatment perturbs the fitness landscape. We investigated how cisplatin, an analog of platinum salts used as a standard therapy for primary TNBC, impacted the stability of the clonal dynamics in the three TNBC PDX (TNBC-SA609, TNBC-SA535, TNBC-SA1035).

%we investigate whether establishing baseline fitness measures could help to interpret selection under drug administration. We first present the TNBC-SA609 series in detail and make an observation about early response to cisplatin treatment. We then analyse two additional TNBC PDX lines to check the reproducibility  and generalizability of our observation.

\subsubsection{Repeated platinum exposure introduced drug resistance in \textit{p53 mutant} TNBC PDXs} 
 To test pharmacologic perturbation with cisplatin (platinum) impacted the stability of the fitness landscape of the TNBC series, we propagated a separate branch, for each of the series (\textbf{\autoref{fig:schematic} ,\autoref{fig:treatedtimeseriesgreen} a, b, c}). Cisplatin (2mg/kg) was administered once every 3 days for 8 doses maximum (Q3Dx8 max) through intraperitoneal (IP) injections, over at least four successive passages to induce drug resistance  (\textbf{\autoref{fig:SA609allcyclescisplatin}, also see methods}). Gradual onset of platinum resistance was physically confirmed with progressive reduction in tumour growth inhibition (TGI) \cite{hather2014growth} (\%TGI from first to last cycle: TNBC-SA609=77\%-4.7\%; TNBC-SA1035= 76\%-15\%; TNBC-SA535= 58\%-16\%, \textbf{\autoref{fig:SA609allcyclescisplatin} b-d}).
 
 For each serially treated tumour, a parallel set of transplanted mice were left untreated, establishing corresponding drug `holiday' samples (\textbf{See methods for detailed experimental design, \textbf{\autoref{fig:treatmentdesignMTD} a}}). Briefly, We coded the treated passages with `T' and untreated with `U' initialised by the X3 untreated (U) passage in SA609 TNBC, X4 untreated (U) in SA1035 TNBC and X5 untreated (U) in  TNBC-SA535 (\textbf{\autoref{fig:treatedtimeseriesgreen} a, b, c}). In TNBC-SA609, the first treatment passage (\textit{X4 UT}) exhibited rapid tumour shrinkage (>50\% of initial size). However, \textit{X5 UTT}, \textit{X6 UTTT} and \textit{X7 UTTTT} had progressively less response, indicating drug resistance and positive growth kinetics (\textbf{\autoref{fig:SA609allcyclescisplatin} b}).


\subsubsection{Resistant clones in all treated lines were derived from the same clone in TNBC-SA609 PDX}
For TNBC-SA609, total of 5 independent transplant lineages  were surveyed with technical replicates for lines 1, 2 (\textbf{\autoref{fig:treatedtimeseriesgreen} a}, (\textbf{\autoref{fig:schematic} a, details in methods}).
Decomposing the growth dynamics over (\textit{X3 U}; \textit{X4 UT}; \textit{X5 UTT}; \textit{X6 UTTT}; \textit{X7 UTTTT}) into clonal trajectories with DLP+ analysis suggested sustained cisplatin treatment inverted the fitness landscape. In particular, for TNBC-SA609 line 2, growth dynamics over (\textit{X3 U; X4 UT; X5 UTT; X6 UTTT; X7 UTTTT}) reproducibly resulted in expansion of \textbf{clone B} and its derivative \textbf{clones (A and R)}, from a starting population comprised primarily of clones C, D and B (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609} c, d, e}).

Clone A in the phylogeny is derived from clone B \textbf{(\autoref{fig:landscapefitness} a-left)} , but with a distinct clonal genotype (fewer copies of \textit{MYC} and deletions at \textit{RB1}, \textit{PRDM9} and \textit{NUDT15} loci), (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609} a, b)}, swept to fixation comprising 48\% (\textit{X4 UT}), 98\% (\textit{X5 UTT}), 100\% (\textit{X6 UTTT}) and 100\% (\textit{X7 UTTTT}) of cells across the treated series (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609} c)}.


%Notably, the high fitness clones E, H, G, D from the untreated series exhibited low fitness coefficients in the treatment series and were no longer detected (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609} d}, \textbf{\autoref{fig:landscapefitness})}. Conversely, Clones A, and B, comprising a low fitness phylogenetic superclade, distinct from high fitness clones E and F in the untreated series, were the precursors to the resistant clone R \textbf{(\autoref{fig:SA609Rxnew} d)},    \textbf{(\autoref{fig:landscapefitness})} Thus, cisplatin perturbation resulted in a near complete inversion of the fitness landscape.

\subsubsection{Resistant clones in TNBC-SA609 share the same precursor}
Next, we examined whether the fitness inversion dynamics as a result of cisplatin chemotherapy in TNBC-SA609 PDX model are due to stochastic effect or real.
We collected DLP+ on all the established parallel replicate timeseries of TNBC-SA609 with cisplatin treatment shown as line 2 and line 3 in \textbf{\autoref{fig:treatedtimeseriesgreen} a}, and duplicate experiments of specific time points. We observed the same type of clonal dynamics as of line 1, briefly, a phylogenetic branch of the population which has low fitness in the untreated control branch is repeatedly observed to selectively expand on treatment. The precursor clone B that gave rise to clone A in line 1, also gave rise to another resistant clone R in \textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609} d-Line 2}. Time points analysis of line 3 also exhibited expansion of precursor clone B started giving rise to clone A, that was again found to be reversed in drug holiday sample of \textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609} Line 3}. This indicates that the fitness inversion is not a stochastic effect and establishes with precision that high fitness lineages in the untreated setting are selectively pruned, while low fitness lineages in the untreated setting selectively expand.

%.....................................................................

\subsection{Inversion of fitness landscape is generalizable under cisplatin selective pressure}
To test the generalizability of the observed drug selection dynamics with cisplatin, we explored two additional TNBC PDX timeseries treated with cisplatin, derived from the patients identified above as TNBC-SA1035 and TNBC-SA535, in the untreated regime  (\textbf{\autoref{fig:treatedtimeseriesgreen}  b, c)}. 

\subsubsection{TNBC-SA1035 PDX also presented expansion of high fitness clone with cisplatin}
From another independent TNBC-SA1035 PDX system, in total of 14,170 single cells (including both treated and un-treated) were generated, where 4,444 passed the quality filters. The experimental design diagram is shown in \textbf{\autoref{fig:treatedtimeseriesgreen} b}.
 The treated branch with cisplatin starting at X5, X6, X7, and X8 comprising 1,596 filtered cells. 833 cells belonged to the drug-holiday timepoints (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype1035} d}). Phylogenetic inference followed by cutting the tree yielded 11 clones (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype1035} c, d, e}, {\autoref{fig:landscapefitness} a, b-right}). In the treated branch, clonal fractions were A(0.065), B(0.129), C(0.132), D(0.066), E(0.055), F(0.018), G(0.205), H(0.144), I(0.094), J(0.014), and K(0.078) {\autoref{fig:landscapefitness} c-right}) . In this regime, G (1+s = 1.01 $\pm$ 0.0123) and H (1+s = 1.02 $\pm$ 0.0135), which were among the clones with lower fitness in absence of treatment, rose to occupy 73\% at X8 while clone E (1 + s = 0.993 $\pm$ 0.0344) fell from about 10\% at X5 to undetectable at X8. As compare to clone E,
 \textbf{Clone H} with highest fitness coefficient in TNBC-SA1035, exhibits predominantly copy number gain of some genes at chr8 locus, including MCM4 \cite {issac2019mcm2, stoeber2001dna, kwok2015prognostic}, PRKDC \cite {tan2020prkdc, sun2017prkdc, zhang2019prkdc} and ASPH and copy loss of some genes at chr19, including SLC7A9 (being under research for potential role in tumor suppressor activities) \cite {bhutia2016slc, ji2018function, broer2020amino, ganapathy2015slc5a8, gupta2006slc5a8} (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype1035} a, b}).
 
 
\subsubsection{High fitness clone emerged from the existing starting population with cisplatin in TNBC-SA535 PDX}
To further explore cisplatin induced clonal dynamics, We acquired a timeseries transplants with treated and untreated branches of TNBC-SA535, similar to other two TNBCs (TNBC-SA609, TNBC-SA1035) \textbf{\autoref{fig:treatedtimeseriesgreen} c}.
We generated a total of 15,302 single cells (including both treated and un treated) out of which 4,023 passed our quality filters.
We established a cisplatin treated timeseries starting from timepoint X6, and continued cisplatin treatment for 5 cycles up to X10, generating a total of 1,425 cells from scWGS (mean = 356, $\sigma$ = 159 per timepoint) from 5 cycles. A cut of the phylogenetic tree inferred over all cells in this series, resulted in 11 clones (\textbf{\autoref{fig:landscapefitness} a, b, c-middle}). 
In the treated branch, clonal fractions were A(0.156), B(0.066), C(0.140), D(0.194), E(0.182), F(0.151), and G(0.112). In this regime, \textbf{clone A} emerged with the highest selection coefficient (1 + s = 1.03 $\pm$  0.0152) (1 + s = 1.02 $\pm$ 0.0116). Notably, clone G (1+s = 1.01 $\pm$ 0.0115) had low fitness coefficients under treatment, whereas, \textbf{clone A} displayed high fitness emerging from already present initial population, taking fitness advantage under drug selection (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype535cisplatin} c, d, e}).

\subsection{Fitness inversion summary from all 3 TNBC PDXs under cisplatin regime}
In each series, emergent clones on treatment were distinct in phylogenetic origin from those with high fitness in the untreated setting (\textbf{\autoref{fig:landscapefitness} a}). \texttt{fitClone} modeling of treatment timeseries indicated an inversion of the clone fitness landscapes (\textbf{\autoref{fig:landscapefitness} b}), reflecting suppression of high fitness clones that dominated in the absence of treatment and expansion of low fitness and/or previously unobserved genotypes. In all series, the rank order of clone-specific fitted selection coefficients (\textbf{\autoref{fig:landscapefitness} c}) was substantially altered in treated samples relative to untreated samples (\textbf{\autoref{fig:landscapefitness} d}). In particular, for TNBC-SA609 line 2, growth dynamics over (\textit{X3 U; X4 UT; X5 UTT; X6 UTTT; X7 UTTTT}) reproducibly resulted in expansion of clone B and its derivative clones (A and R), from a starting population comprised primarily of clones C, D and B (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609} d,e}). Notably, resistant clones in all three replicate treated lines were derived from clone B and were phylogenetically distinct from clone H - the highest fitness clone in the treatment-naive setting  (\textbf{\autoref{fig:landscapefitness} a-c left panel}), (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609} d, e}). Observation from the other two TNBC series also supported a fitness inversion. Importantly, in both TNBC-SA535 and TNBC-SA1035, both high and low fitness clones were observed in initial conditions, ruling out sampling bias as a strict determinant of selection dynamics. TNBC-SA535 and TNBC-SA1035 each exhibited monotonically decreasing prevalences of treatment-naive high fitness clones and increasing low fitness clones. Specifically, low fitness clones in the untreated series (clone A from 24 to 71\% in TNBC-SA535; clones G: 10 to 33\%, H: 6 to 40\%, in TNBC-SA1035), with the fittest clones under no treatment (e.g., TNBC-SA535 clone G; TNBC-SA1035 clone E) decreasing to near zero prevalence. The majority of the other clones were also impacted by treatment in all three series. For example, in TNBC-SA535, the relative fitness rank of clone G fell from first to sixth and clone B fell from third to tenth. Clone H increased from sixth to second and clone J from seventh to third. In TNBC-SA1035, clone E fell from first to seventh and clone A fell from third to eighth. Clone G increased from tenth to second. The impact across the whole fitness landscape was further reflected in the pairwise probability of positive selection distributions. These distributions were statistically significantly increased in the treatment series  (\textbf{\autoref{fig:landscapefitness} d}), indicating that fewer clones were under neutral selection in the cisplatin setting, and that selection coefficients exhibited a wider variance between clones. 
%...........................................................
\subsection {Clone-specific cisplatin resistance has a fitness cost}
Next, we asked whether the clonal dynamics in the presence of cisplatin were reversible by exploring the replicates of drug holiday samples in
 all 3 TNBC series. We implemented a drug holiday design whereby at each treated timepoint, we tested the impact of removing the drug in a replicate transplant (\textbf{\autoref{fig:schematic} a}, (\textbf{\autoref{fig:treatedgrowthcurves} a}). In the case of TNBC-SA609, the inverted fitness is reversible in a short interval, (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609} d-}, \textit{X5 UTU; X6 UTTU; X7 UTTTU}) when in competition with precursor clones, under no treatment. In the first drug holiday \textit{X5 UTU}, clonal composition reverted to consist predominantly of precursor clone B with 90\% abundance, and only 10\% abundance from clone A (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype609} d, e}). However, in \textit{X6  UTTU} and \textit{X7 UTTTU} no reversion was detected, and these populations consisted of $>$99\% Clone A, similar to their on-treatment analogues. Thus, when clonal competition was possible in the absence of drug, cells derived from the precursor B clade outcompeted clone A, and clone-specific cisplatin resistance displays a fitness cost. Moreover, the genotype specificity of reversion between \textit{X4 UT} to \textit{X5 UTU} indicates that the clonal dynamics can be attributed to selection of genomically defined clones with differential fitness. The TNBC-SA1035 series exhibited more moderate reversibility. Clone G contracted from 10\% at \textit{X5 UT} to 9\% at \textit{X6 UTU}, compared to 20\% at \textit{X6 UTT}, and clone A contracted from XX\% at \textit{X7 UTTT} to XY\% at \textit{X8 UTTTU} (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype1035} c-e}). 
Similarly, in TNBC-SA535 (\textbf{\autoref{fig:genotype535cisplatin} c-e}) the highest fitness clone A in the treatment setting either maintained or decreased clonal fractions in the holiday setting, and clone E exhibited clonal fractions similar to consecutively treated timepoints at parallel drug holiday timepoints \textit{X7 UTTU}, \textit{X8 UTTU}, and \textit{X9 UTTTU}.  However, clone E increased to 32\% in \textit{X10 UTTTTU} from 10\% in \textit{X9 UTTTT}.  Lack of monotonically increasing growth dynamics of treatment resistant clones in the holiday setting, resulting in only stable or decreasing growth, emphasizes the fitness cost of resistance and further implicates drug induced selection of clones with low fitness in the absence of drug.     



%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Comparison of fitness landscape of cisplatin and CX-5461 in TNBC-SA535 PDX timeseries}
So far we have applied only cisplatin (platinum) to TNBC PDX in a timeseries manner to track copy number based genomic clones. Next, we asked how clonal dynamics behave if same tumor is perturbed with different drugs. 
One TNBC-SA535, was BRCA1 deficient (HRD-Dup), so we established a repeated CX-5461 (G4-stabilizer, see introduction) drug exposure timeseries \textbf{(\autoref{fig:schematic} a)}, same experimental design as with cisplatin, \textbf{(\autoref{fig:SA535CX5461} a)} to compare cisplatin induced clonal dynamics. Platinum (cisplatin) is a standard chemotherapeutic agent whereas, CX-5461 is a G4 quadruplex stabilizer drug, known to have synthetic lethality with BRCA deficiency.

We established a timeseries TNBC-SA535 TNBC PDX treated and untreated branches of CX-5461 similar and in parallel to cisplatin.
 CX-5461 treatment started from timepoint X5 to X9 while cisplatin was given in parallel from X6 to X10 \textbf{\autoref{fig:SA535CX5461} a}. Another untreated timeseries simultaneously was set up for comparison of dynamics and tumor growth rate record.
We collected sc-WGS from consecutively transplanted treated and untreated all aforementioned timepoints for a raw total of 44,618 single cells (mean = 1274.8, $\sigma$ = 300.8 per library. After aggressive filtering for a very high quality human genomes and removing dividing cells, we analysed a total of 7,894 (mean = 1127.7, $\sigma$ = 708.2 per timepoint) single cells from the whole TNBC-SA535 PDX dataset \textbf{(\autoref{fig:SA535combinebarplots} a)}.

We acquired scWGS on 7 consecutively transplanted untreated timepoints (X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, X9, X10) generating a total of 1,968 single cells (mean = 328, $\sigma$ = 104.5 per timepoint).
Clonal fractions calculated as I(0.002), J(0.3206), K(0.0071), L(0.0051), N(0.0066), P(0.0056), Q(0.6011), R(0.0386), S(0.0097), U(0.0036). 

Simultaneously, from a Cisplatin treated timeseries starting from timepoint X6, and continued for 5 cycles up to X10, generating a total of 2,921 cells from scWGS (mean = 584.2, $\sigma$ = 190.5 per timepoint) from 5 cycles. A cut of the phylogenetic tree inferred over all cells in this series, resulted in 13 clones.
In the drug cycle treatment Cisplatin line, clonal fractions were
calculated as I(0.1568), J(0.0575), K(0.0791), L(0.1852), N(0.0065), O(0.001), P(0.1072), Q(0.0387), R(0.0524), S(0.0839), T(0.1938) and U(0.038).

Moreover, from a CX-5461 treated timeseries, starting from timepoint X5, and continuing for 5 cycles up to X9, we generated a total of 3,005 cells from scWGS (mean = 601, $\sigma$ = 342 per timepoint). A cut of the phylogenetic tree inferred over all cells in this series, resulted in 13 clones. In the drug cycle treatment CX-5461 line, clonal fractions were I(0.0004), J(0.0077), K(0.0027), L(0.0013), M(0.0389), N(0.0709), O(0.0795), P(0.003), Q(0.005), R(0.3428), S(0.016), U(0.4319).


\subsubsection{CX-5461 treated tumors were more responsive as compared to cisplatin}
Tumor growth curves from displayed progressively less response of the tumors in last cycle of drug as compared to the first, indicating initiation of drug resistance to both cisplatin and CX-5461 \textbf{(\autoref{fig:SA535CX5461} b, c)}. 
Gradual onset of platinum resistance was physically confirmed with progressive reduction in tumour growth inhibition (TGI) (\%TGI from first to last cycle of: cisplatin=58\%-16\%; CX-5461= 71\%-35\% \textbf{\autoref{fig:SA609allcyclescisplatin} d}, \textbf{\autoref{fig:SA535CX5461} b}). 
These values show that tumor resistant behaviour and positive growth kinetics induced earlier in cisplatin tumors as compared to CX-5461.

\subsubsection{Drug resistant clones arise from the same precursor}
Integer heat map of copy number heterogeneity was computed using \texttt{sitka} and interestingly cisplatin and CX-5461 treated cells clustered independently from each other and from the un treated cell clusters \textbf{\autoref{fig:SA535combinebarplots} a}. Clonal abundance for the un treated time series depicted increase of Clone Q till passage 7 (X7) but then gradual decrease favouring emerging of clone J in the later generations \textbf{(\autoref{fig:SA535combinebarplots} b (left top panel))}. In cisplatin treated series, clone T showed up expanding under the drug whereas with CX-5461 favored emerging of clone U.
Moreover, the resistant branches having \textbf{clone S} and \textbf{clone T} for cisplatin and \textbf{clone U} for CX-5461, both derived from precursor \textbf{clone R}. Clone R was present early in variable proportions in the two branches, but did not have fitness in the untreated, present, but at a very minor proportion. Perhaps, its giving an idea that independently, drug resistance has apparently a favored clonal starting point in this PDX \textbf{\autoref{fig:SA535combinebarplots} c}. 

Comparing drug holiday samples from cisplatin and CX-5461 treated time series showed resistant clones are reversible early in the treatment of cisplatin but not with CX-5461 (\textbf{\autoref{fig:SA535combinebarplots} b middle and right panels}).
These results require further confirmation by calculating fitness coefficients \texttt{fitClone} and also by treating the other two TNBC PDX with CX-5461.



\section{Discussion}

In this chapter, we have shown that decoding the contributions of clonal competition in the course of tumour growth with and without drug selection can be achieved by measuring and modeling cellular dynamics with granular scWGS timeseries over several months to years.
Single cell whole genome sequencing allowed for robust application of population genetics statistical models, and their subsequent validation through experimental mixtures and timeseries observations.

In population genetics, the repeated observation of dominance or decline in specific clones, defined here by CNA genotypes, implies that either the genotype or a factor heritably linked to the genotype, is deterministic. 
While we do not rule out that, for example, linked epigenetic or mutation features could be driving selection, our results are consistent with changes in the genome architecture linked to increased fitness.  
Our results suggest that positive selection attributed to copy number changes of all scales may be under-appreciated. This has implications for interpreting etiologic processes of \textit{TP53} driven cancers where the rates of structural variation acquisition and deviation away from diploid configurations confers quantitative fitness advantages.

In tumour evolution within patients, copy number alterations as a key biological process is revealing impact on treatment outcomes and co-morbidities \cite{Bielski2018-cm}, innate and adaptive immune response \cite{Bakhoum2018-ko,Davoli2017-mf}, the root cause of major genomic reconfigurations~\cite{Umbreit2020-ls} and evolutionary plasticity \cite{Lopez2020-ku}. 
Our work here suggests that \textit{TP53} mutation can lead to structural alterations are observed in breast cancer patients, thereby representing a realistic model for studying how the impact of driver mutations inducing genomic instability leads to clonal expansions and evolutionary selection. Variously through single cell approaches \cite{gao2016punctuated} or computational reconstruction of evolutionary histories \cite{Gerstung2020-jl}, the evolutionary impact of structural variations is still a work in progress. Over successive generations in three TNBC PDX, in the context of cisplatin perturbation, emergent copy number changes contribute to the kinetics of the fitness landscape, consistent with a continual diversifying mechanism that induces competitive clonal advantages.  
The impact of drug intervention on cancer evolution is a key determinant of patient outcomes across all human cancers.  
We show that resistance to platinum in polyclonal cancers was consistent with a fitness cost, interpreted from a repeatedly observed inversion of the fitness landscape relative to untreated controls. We suggest this could be exploited in future therapeutic strategies. Forecasting the trajectories of cancer clones is of immediate importance to understanding therapeutic response in cancer and for deploying adaptive approaches \cite{Vasan2019-mt}. The presence within a tumour of lineage precursors to resistant genotypes may define time windows within which clonal competition could mediate plasticity to treatment. We suggest that population genetics modeling of timeseries tumour or tumour cell-free DNA measurements to predict clonal evolution is tractable, but will require complementary measurements of genotypic clonal abundance and phenotypic plasticity to gain comprehensive understanding. Further study with timeseries modeling will provide insight into therapeutic strategies promoting early intervention, drug combinations and evolution-aware approaches to clinical management \cite{Acar2020-tf}.
