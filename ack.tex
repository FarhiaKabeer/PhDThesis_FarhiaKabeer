\chapter{Acknowledgments}

Before all, thank you to Allah Almighty, my Creator, who has led me to make it this far.

My deepest gratitude goes to my supervisor Professor Samuel Aparicio. I've been lucky to have you to guide and support me throughout my PhD journey. You have taught me the essential attitude towards scientific research, which is a lesson I will cherish forever, Thank you!

I am also deeply indebted to the members of my supervisory committee, Dr. Sohrab Shah for his special interest in bioinformatic analysis and suggestions through out my PhD programme, Dr. Francois Benard, and Dr. David Huntsman, as well as my Chair Dr. William Lockwood, for their valuable inputs, guidance and encouragements. My special thanks to Hakwoo Lee, for our knowledgeable discussions and his readiness to give me a hand. I can't forget to thank the experienced single cell technician's team of the Aparicio lab; Jazmine, Justina and Jecy for handling my thousands and thousands of single cells on the robotic spotters and sequencing. I would also like to thank Dr. Ciara O'Flanagan for all our chats and laughter. 

I humbly extend my thanks to Dr. Steven McKinney for his support involving the statistics for my data. My sincere gratitude to Dr. Kieran Campbell and Sohrab Salehi for bioinformatic analysis on my data. Dr. Hoa Tran and Dr. Mirela Andronescu for their unconditional collaboration and support for bioinformatic analysis. 

I would like to extend my regards to all Shah lab members, and the administrative and laboratory staff in the Aparicio lab for their continued support with day-to-day discussions and operations.

Finally, I would like to mention my late parents, to whom I owe so much, who taught me to take on life's challenges with determination. To my mother-in-law for her continuous emotional support and prayers for success. 

Lastly, I owe the deepest gratitude to my husband for his advice, his patience, in the face of my most difficult hours, and for his faith in me. To my children, who would text during late hours experiments asking  `` No pressure, mom, we're fine but just wondering when you'll be back home?'', and to my husband who would nod solemnly at my monologues, I don't have the words to show you how grateful I have been to have you at my side.
