\chapter{Acknowledgments}

My deepest gratitude to my supervisor Professor Samuel Aparicio. I have been extremely
fortunate to have a mentor who guided and supported me in my PhD
research with great patience. Sam taught me to think “problem in science”,
 and think “why and how to find the solution”, which in my opinion is the essential attitude towards scientific research.
