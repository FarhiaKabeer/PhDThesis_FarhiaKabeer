\chapter{Acknowledgments}

My deepest gratitude to my supervisor Professor Samuel Aparicio. I have been extremely

I would also like to thank the members of my supervisory committee, Dr. Sohrab Shah, Dr. Francois Benard, and Dr. David Huntsman, as well as my Chair Dr. William Lockwood, for their valuable inputs and guidance throughout my program. My special attributes to Hakwoo Lee, for his knowledgeable discussions and  readiness to give me hands whenever I requested.

I thank Steven McKinney for his intellectual support for the statistics of my data. I thank
