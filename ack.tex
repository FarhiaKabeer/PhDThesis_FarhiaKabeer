\chapter{Acknowledgments}

Thanks to Allah Almighty, my Creator, Who enabled me to make this far.

I submit my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Professor Samuel Aparicio. I have been extremely fortunate to have a mentor who guided and supported me in my PhD research with great patience. Sam taught me to think ``problem in science'', and think 11why and how to find the solution'', which in my opinion is the essential attitude towards scientific research. 

I am deeply indebted to the members of my supervisory committee, Dr. Sohrab Shah, for his special interest in bioinformatic analysis and suggestions through out my PhD programme, Dr. Francois Benard, and Dr. David Huntsman, as well as my Chair Dr. William Lockwood, for their valuable inputs, guidance and encouragements during my program. My special attributes to Hakwoo Lee, for his knowledgeable discussions and  readiness to give me hands whenever I requested. I cannot forget to thank the experienced single cell technician's team of Aparicio lab, Jazmine, Justina and Jecy for handling my thousands and thousands of single cells on the robotic spotters and sequencing. I would like to thank Dr. Ciara O'Flanagan for all our chit-chat and laughter. 

I humbly extend my thanks to Dr. Steven McKinney for his support for the statistics of my data. My sincere gratitude to Dr. Kieran Campbell and Sohrab Salehi for bioinformatic analysis on my data. Dr. Hoa Tran and Dr. Mirela Andronescu for their unconditional collaboration and support for bioinformatic analysis on my data, and discussions on call regardless of the time.  

I would like to extend my regards to all lab members, the administrative and laboratory staff in the Aparicio lab for their continued support with day-to-day discussions and operations.

Finally, I am grateful to my late parents who trained me to cope under any circumstances and taught me how to face challenges in life successfully and my mother in law for her continuous emotional support and valuable prayers for my success. Lastly, I owe my heartiest gratitude to my caring husband for his advice, his patience on my screams in bad hours and his faith in me because he always understood. I don't have words to thank my three children for their understanding of my situation. During my late hours experiments, they would text me asking  ` no pressure mom! We all are fine but just wondering when will you be back home?'. I am happy we were all in this together.
